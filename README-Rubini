This is the "Born Again THOS", and THOS was the "Two Hour Operating
System".  I wrote Thos in a 2-hour lesson a few times since September 2010.

Thos is done: it must be written in two hours. This one, Bathos, is a
reorganization of the code to put forward the idea of a very simple
operating system, without interrupts so far, but with some more
drivers and features, since my students were really using Thos for
real work.

All documentation is in doc/ (you need TeX and Texinfo to compile it,
but if you download the tarball, output files are already there).  The
first part of the document is still Thos, and it matches the commit
history, because this project is actually a spin-off of Thos, from where
Thos was complete.

However, after tag "v2012-12" (which is a Thos tag), the history is
not driven by didactic purposes but by the feature set I need over
time. I try to remain clean and ordered in the commits, but I cannot
be sure about it, and sometimes bugs are commited and fixed at a later
time.

Enjoy
